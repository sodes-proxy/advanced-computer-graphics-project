# Advanced Computer Graphics Project

Final project of my Advanced computer Graphics class, made in unity with the Universal render Pipeline.

# Things you need

To succesfully see firsthand the results in your computer you need to install the Universal Render Pipeline in the Package Manager and select it as the main render pipeline in project settings > Graphics.

# About the project

The project contains 3 shaders:

- Water ripple shader: present in the pond and the floor, it has the capability to change certain factors like the direction of the wind, intensity of the rain, etc.
- Rainy window shader: simulates the effect of rain drops on a surface transparent surface
- Mandelbrot set shader: creates a fractal (mandelbrot set) that can you can move, rotate, zoom and activate symmetry.
